# minimal-tool-chain

This repository contains code for a minimal Java tool chain with

* Some Java source code, see `src/main/java`
* Some JUnit tests, see `src/test/java`
* An Ant build file with targets for `build`, `test`, `jar`, and `clean`. See `build.xml`.
* The source files are organized according to the Maven standard directory layout. See https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html .This facilitates integration with other tools, like the Continuous Integration tool Travis.
* We don't use any dependencies to download libraries. Instead, all dependent libraries are in included in the project in the `lib` folder.
* There is a fork of this project that uses Gradle instead of Ant, and that has a `.travis.yml` file for integration with Travis. See https://github.com/llbit/minimal-tool-chain
